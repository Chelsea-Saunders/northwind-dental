Throughout his growing up years he had to go through his share of dental treatment. From fillings, crowns, root canals, and implants, he has learned first-hand how important a good dentist is, and how good dentistry can contribute to a better quality of life.
            Becoming a dentist wasn’t something that Dr. Dawson ever saw himself doing, until he was married with two kids. He had worked in construction since he was a teenager, but knew that he wanted to pursue the education he’d never had.
            While taking classes at Brigham Young University-Idaho he became fascinated with the human body and decided to dive deeper into a degree in healthcare. Around this time, a friend allowed him to job shadow at his dental office, answered a million questions, and shared his joy for dentistry with Dr. Dawson, which opened a new door of discovery and excitement for him. From that time on, Dr. Dawson knew that becoming a dentist was not just a dream, it was something that he was going to make happen.
            After completing his degree in Exercise Science at BYU-Idaho, Dr. Dawson received his DMD degree at the Medical University of South Carolina and then moved his family across the country to Billings, MT where he began working at a very good, but fast-paced practice. He loved helping his patients. Whether it was helping someone in pain, seeing tears in a patient’s eyes as they joyfully received their new denture, or performing a child’s first dental exam, every patient that Dr. Dawson saw, confirmed to him that he had indeed chosen the right career. But working in a fast-paced dental practice wasn’t what he saw himself doing long-term; he wanted to practice in a place where he had time to visit with each of his patients and get to know them personally.
            With this goal in mind, Dr. Dawson moved his family to Alaska in the winter of 2018. Between the kind people and the beautiful outdoors, it took no time at all for his family to feel at home in Alaska. They knew they were here to stay.
            Dr. Dawson has loved the slower pace that he has found here, and getting to know each of his patients has been a delight. He feels blessed to be surrounded by so many good people who have influenced his life for the better. He loves nothing more than to help people feel better about their oral health, or give them new confidence in their smile. If you have questions or concerns, or if you aren’t happy with the way your teeth look or feel, he invites you to come talk to him.
            In addition to dentistry, Dr. Dawson loves spending time with his family, camping, fishing, hiking, hunting and enjoying the great outdoors. He has been married to his wife Kiama for 18 years, and together they have 5 kids.
            Dr. Dawson is a member of the American Dental Association, the Academy of General Dentistry, the Alaska Dental Society and the Matanuska-Susitna Dental Society.`,img:[{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/DSC_0772.jpg",alt:"Dr. Thayne Dawson"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/DawsonFamily-20.jpg",alt:"Dawson Family"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/DawsonFamily-73.jpg",alt:"Dawson Family"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/IMG-0412.jpg",alt:"Dr. Thayne Dawson"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/drDawson.jpg",alt:"Dr. Thayne Dawson"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/fam_edited.jpg",alt:"Dawson Family Ice Skating"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/dentistry1.png",alt:"Dr. Dawson with Patient"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/fam1.jpg",alt:"Dr. Thayne Dawson"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/family2020.jpg",alt:"Dr. Thayne Dawson"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/hiking.jpg",alt:"Dr. Thayne Dawson"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/DSC_0724.jpg",alt:"Dr. Thayne Dawson"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/IMG-9469.jpg",alt:"Dr. Thayne Dawson"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/IMG-9625.jpg",alt:"Dr. Thayne Dawson"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/shed.jpg",alt:"Dr. Thayne Dawson"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/thayne-fish.jpg",alt:"Dr. Thayne Dawson"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/thayne-grad-20.jpg",alt:"Dr. Thayne Dawson"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/DSC_0761.jpg",alt:"Mrs. Dr. Thayne Dawson"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/IMG-0505.png",alt:"Dr. Thayne Dawson"},{src:"./src/images/team/thayne/IMG-9410.png",alt:"Dr. Thayne Dawson"}]},{id:"receptionist",name:"Jessica",role:"Office Receptionist",description:`Jessica is more than just a receptionist.
